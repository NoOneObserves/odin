# Landing Page
This is just the exact web page suggested to do on the Odin Project's assignment. Click [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FNoOneObserves%2Fodin%2Fblob%2Fmain%2Fproject-landing-page%2Findex.html=) to see the final result!

## Desired outcome
I decide to not add images or secondary links to focus more on the creation of the page itself than the aestetic or the purpose. In the future, I'll do a personal Landing Page using this code as inspiration!

Here's the desired outcome:

## Thoughts and Process
Firstly, I divide the outcome's images into 5 sections:
1. Hero: has a `navigation bar`(logo + link) and a `main section` (text&button + img) 
2. Info: 4 small `containers`(each one has: img + text on the bottom) align horizzontally and equally spaced
3. Quote: a centered `quote` with the autor
4. Contact: tricky, a `box` (text + button) centered on his section 
5. Footer: a `copyright` mark
#####
I start to code the HTML with the CSS in mind, adding `div` and `class` where they were useful.
After that I code the CSS: I styled each section one at the time and focused on the general appealing.
#####
I loved using the flex-box method indeed, definitly a better option instead of the "grid" method.
#####
Probably, the only and most annoying part was to align the section to the center because I didn't think how the shrinking would have effected on each one of them. SO FRUSTRATING!
However, I had a big problem while I was coding the CSS and I need to improve on this aspect: how to reduce and "corporate" some reused portion of code. I hope to understand it in the future!

### TO DO
Optimaze the code!
