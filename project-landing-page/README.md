# Landing Page
This is just the exact web page suggested to do on the Odin Project's assignment.


## Desired outcome
I decide to not add images or secondary links to focus more the creation of the page itself than its aestetic/purpose. 

Here the desired outcome:
![desired outcome](./desired-outcome.png)


## Thoughts and Process
I started to code the HTML first: I divided the outcome's images into 5 sections:
1. Header: has a `navigation bar`(logo + link) and a `main section` (text&button + img) 
2. Info: 4 small `containers`(each one has: img + text on the bottom) align horizzontally and equally spaced
3. Quote: a centered text with the autor
4. Contact: tricky, a `modal`(text + button) centered on his section
5. Footer: `copyright` text 

In the future, I'll do a personal Landing Page using this code!
