                    Brownies are often served as a dessert accompanied with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream, but they are actually born as a dessert on the go, practical and easy to carry.

                    And I reccomand to do it! It's beginner-freindly to make so it's impossible to go wrong. Also you can even add and change the ingredients if you like different type of chocolate or if you like to have some consistency(I reccomand to add 100gr of nuts).

                <ol>
                    <li>Break the chocolate into small pieces(by hand or by the help of the knif) and melt the chocolate in a vertical pot and add also the butter together. If you don't want to use the stove, you can also put the chocolate and the butter on a bowl and microwave it. But be careful! Remember to stir every 30sec if you decide to use this method.</li>
                    <li>In another bowl, whisk the eggs and sugar, with a pinch of salt at the end.</li>
                    <li>Combine the two compounds and here you can add whatever you want(nuts, chocolate chips...) and mix well.</li>
                    <li>In a square pan, put the mixture and bake it on the oven, previously preheated at 180 degrees - for 25 minutes.</li>
                    <li>When it is cooked, do the toothpick test and remove from the pan. Cut into small squares and voil√†, it's ready to be served!</li>
