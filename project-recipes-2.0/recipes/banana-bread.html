        <h1>Banana bread</h1>
        <p>"Save that banana!"</p>
        <p>This recipe is a great idea to revive those bananas that have been forgotten for who knows how long in the fruit basket, too ripe and of terrible consistency to be eaten like this.
        <br>
        Perfect as a snack, freshly baked they give off an amazing smell...
        <br>
        Imagine the slices of this bread, toasted and stuffed with jam or peanut butter, they are life.</p>
