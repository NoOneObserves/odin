# Recipes

## Description
This is the updated version of the [recipe website](https://github.com/NoOneObserves/odin/tree/main/project-recipes): the new site is [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/NoOneObserves/odin/blob/main/project-recipes-2.0/index.html).


## Major changes
- Added CSS (external method) without using 'grid' layout
- Recipe's texts translated in English
- More readable and articulate README


## Thoughts and Process
First of all, I used canva to decide the new style for the website: consequently, I modified the homepage to make it more visually interactive. 

The part where I list the recipes, was the hardest part to program especially with the margins. In fact, I couldn't align the subparagraphs.

After this, the styling for the recipes was a breeze to make.
The only problem was figuring out when to use ```class``` and ```id``` but I make it somehow.
